# Diabetes_ML
 am excited to share my journey of creating my first machine learning model using the Scikit-learn library, focusing on predicting diabetes outcomes. This project not only enhanced my understanding of machine learning concepts but also provided hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
